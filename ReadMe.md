## Introduction

Welcome to Vixeny, a web framework that offers both the strengths of functional programming and extensive support for other paradigms. Whether you're a seasoned functional programmer, new to the concept, or even if you choose to take a different path altogether, Vixeny has something to offer you.

### Embracing Different Styles

Vixeny is about flexibility, expressiveness, and the joy of coding. Our philosophy embraces various programming approaches, all supported by key features:

- **Functional, but Not Exclusive:** Functional programming is a tool, not a mandate, within Vixeny. If you prefer other paradigms, you'll find support and features to suit your needs. It's about providing different avenues to success, not making things difficult.
- **Modular and Predictable:** Thanks to its functional nature, Vixeny ensures easy testing with predictable and immutable structures. This design fosters a robust and reliable development environment.
- **Opt-in Side Effects:** In Vixeny, side effects are an option, not a given. You have the control to explicitly create them when needed. Vixeny can't be mutated without your direct intention.
- **High-Performance, Elegance, and More:** Whether functional principles or other paradigms guide you, Vixeny's commitment to performance, safety, readability, and community remains strong.

In Vixeny, your way of coding is embraced, and your unique approach is celebrated. Dive into our Getting Started guide and discover how Vixeny can meet you where you are and help you build extraordinary web applications.

## Q&A

- **Why doesn't Vixeny support Node.js?**

  Node.js is not supported due to its incompatibility with the Response and Request methods used by Vixeny.
